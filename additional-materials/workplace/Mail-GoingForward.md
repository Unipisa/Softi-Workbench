## Going forward

The upcoming steps that we need to do together are divided to two main aspects:
### The prototype (due November 30th)
1. get feedback on the first iteration
- You can interact with the following examples on the science-stories website:
a. Cave: http://www.sciencestories.io/Q379904
b. Apollo11 AGC: http://www.sciencestories.io/Q138875
c. TAUmus: http://www.sciencestories.io/Q107316563
2. choose three examples for the prototype 
3. _verify that the three examples have Wikidata entities_
4. _create entities if needed and analyze the examples metadata and identify what can be added to the Wikidata entities._

### Guiding curators from collecting metadata to presenting a SWH story
1. review the curator workflow in the SWHAP
2. add necessary steps to the SWHAP workflow (including, inserting metadata to Wikidata, images to Wikimedia, etc.)
3. create a checklist for the curator to be used during the SWHAP 

## The files that are already capturing metadata for TAUmus:
