# Softi moments - a first attempt

*Disclaimer: Here is an incomplete proposal of items and related information to upload to Wikimedia for Softi. I am not sure I understand well enough how things work. So, please bear with me and send me comments, tips, etc. on how to keep on the right track.

Here and there I have also put some of my doubts, in italic: You can find them searching for "Question".*

### Conventions

Wikidata items to be created (to the best of my knowlegde) are identified as Q*xxx.

In the statements, I use braces to pair the name and value of a property. The same for the fields of an uploaded image or video, iFrames, etc.

### Wikipedia article moment

NA

### Timeline moment

Here are the dates of the first and last versions of the codes:

* PER: 13/2/68, 15/2/68 (hand written on the only printout)
* LETT: 13/2/68, 21/3/68 (hand written on the only printout)
* Exec: 5/3/68
* Exec: 5/3/68 (with output)
* Exec: 4/4/68
* Exec: 29/3/68
* Softi-1: no date
* Softi-2: 13/2/68, 5/3/68
* Softi-3: 9/3/68, 4/4/68

*Question: I used inception P571 to indicate the initial date of the time span of the creation of Softi. How do I enter the final date of the time span? I see that Kat has used P2669 discontinued date). I'm afraid both properties do not convey the intended meaning, that is the time span covered by our findings, which is likely shorter than the time span of the project.*

*Question: we might also put here the dates when they were saved in SWH. Again, do we need a new property?*

She then became professor at the Computer Science Department of the University of Pisa. Her contributions to Computer Science were in Computational Intelligence and Bioengineering.

*Question: should we put also Guido, Laura and myself as collectors and curators? Or it is too narcissitic? (Guido says no - Having got a better understanding I think not)*

### Wikidata statements moment
I guess this is done automatically.

### SWH source code moment

Note: Since the links to the GitHub repository work correctly in SWH, it's convenient to create iFrames with the SWHIDs of the pages in the archived repository.

* iFrame-1
     * {Link: [Softi repository- source code branch](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:b0c85c6dd2e62311046c077ee8f57563823408e3;origin=https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi-Workbench;visit=swh:1:snp:c17894ec99edb9bddba17f69d018cfa578593d3b;anchor=swh:1:rev:092a927d8ed365ed600dd4e96932437731749bbb)}

     * {Title: Reconstructed development story of the Softi source code.}

*Question: should we also add direct links to (some of) the code files shown in the Media Gallery moment?*
