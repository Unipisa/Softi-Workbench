# Softi software moments

### This folder provides storage for the images, videos, documents, etc. related to the Softi software. 

The software story moments fall in four classes, with a dedicated sub-folder each: *code_listing*, for PDF versions of the source code, annotated with permalinks to the SWH archive, *media_gallery*, for images of the original source code recovered from non digital documents, *software-library* for links to documents related to the software, and *videos* for related videos.

An entry should be added to the [StoryInventory](..\StoryInventory.md) file for each added item, following the pattern offered in the dedicated section.

Please refer to the [SWHAP@Pisa](https://github.com/SoftwareHeritage/swhapguide/blob/master/SWHAP%40Pisa.pdf#CreateaSWH-story) guidelines for greater details.
