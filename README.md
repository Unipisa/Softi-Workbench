# Softi Workbench

### This is the [SWHAPPE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) workbench for the acquisition of the CEP code to smoothen a curve, developed  by Tonina Starita in 1968. 

This repository was created with the support of the 
[Software Heritage Acquisition Process Pisa Enactor](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) and contains the 
[Information on the acquisition process](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi-Workbench/tree/master/metadata).

The original finds are stored in the [Depository](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi-Depository) 
containing the
[raw materials](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi-Depository/tree/master/raw_materials) and the
[browsable source](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi-Depository/tree/master/browsable_source).

The resulting 
[development history](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi/tree/SourceCode/)  can be found in the [Softi repository](https://github.com/Unipisa/Softi).
